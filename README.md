# 1710_FinalProject

This Project encourages you to try out to be a DJ. Mix different sounds together by clicking on the buttons and try to get them synced up perfectly, like DJs have to during their concerts.
<p> 
I am using the FFT with the Sound library to provide audio visualization for the first track, as after several tries, I could not figure out how to analyze multiple sound tracks, and could not find any information about this online.
</p>
<p> I also tried combining this with the Minim library to have the visualization be powered by the Sound processing library, and implement a pitch shift (the plan was to add a knob to control that as well). However, the Minim and the Sound library did not want to work together,
so had to comment out the Minim code and use the Sound volume.
